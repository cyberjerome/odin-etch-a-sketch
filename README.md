# odin-etch-a-sketch

This project creates a sketch pad grid where users can hover over grid squares to leave a trail, simulating drawing with a pen. The grid is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- Displays a grid of square divs where each div represents a square on the sketch pad.
- Hovering over a grid square permanently changes its color, creating a trail effect.
- Provides a button to create a new grid with a specified number of squares per side.
- Limits the user input for grid size to a maximum of 100.

## Usage

1. Open the HTML file (`index.html`) in a web browser.
2. The initial grid is displayed with a default size of 16x16.
3. Hover the mouse over the grid squares to change their color permanently.
4. Click the "Create New Grid" button at the top of the screen.
5. In the prompt, enter the desired number of squares per side for the new grid (1-100).
6. The existing grid will be removed, and a new grid with the specified size will be generated.
7. Hover over the new grid squares to leave a trail just like before.
